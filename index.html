            During my childhood days in Hanoi, I used to see the steps of time
            in traces of flowers. The instances when I smelled the fragrance of
            Blackboard tree blossoms, I knew autumn had come, and had left parts
            of itself on the dark green leaves. Sadly, it was not until I left
            the city, that I realized those “floral traces” were something very
            “Hanoian”, and never in another place, did I see the passage of time
            in the same flowers again. <br />

          <div class="para">
            Hanoi is a city blessed with wonderful soil and climate to grow
            plants. The great distinction between its four seasons gave Hanoi a
            variety of charming flowers and sweet scents, bringing a poetic but
            subtle charisma to the city. And so, it saddens me when others can
            only think of the city through the lens of regrets for a place that
            suffered decades of war. <br />

            This project is dedicated to the poetic side of my dear city, to a
            part that cannot be seen but can only be felt and sensed. “The
            Floral Timeline of Hanoi” explores 12 kinds of flowers that
            represent each month of the city, their beauty, symbolism, and
            enchantment.
